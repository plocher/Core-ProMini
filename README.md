IO4-based Arduino ProMini baseboard

This design evolved from my Core-ArduinoShield sequence when it became obvious that
the eBay ProMini clones were much cheaper than full sized Arduinos and their clones.

Until the [Core Wemos D1 Mini](/Core-Wemos.html) and [Core-ESP32](/Core-ESP32.html) boards,
this was my go-to building block for field units and other layout automation tasks.
